# Train_Delay_Prediction-
A deep learning based train-delay prediction system for assignment - Anubhav Kesari


This notebook has been developed on kaggle platform, so basic requirements of the kaggle environment is there.
Specifically the notebook uses - keras==2.4.2


This model uses LSTM based network for predicting time delays.
